# 🕵️‍♂️ Outlier & Anomaly Detection in Crime Data

This project demonstrates how to identify **outliers and anomalies** in crime-related datasets using Python. Leveraging statistical techniques and visualization tools, the notebook walks through a full exploratory data analysis (EDA) and anomaly detection pipeline.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation & cleaning  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Z-score / IQR** – Outlier detection  
- **Boxplots / Distribution Plots** – Insightful visual analysis  

---

## 🔍 Objectives
- Load and preprocess real-world crime data  
- Apply statistical methods (Z-Score, IQR) to detect anomalies  
- Visualize potential crime hotspots or irregular activity  
- Identify data quality issues that may skew interpretation  

---

## 📈 Key Features
- **Outlier detection** using Z-score and IQR methods  
- **Interactive visuals** using Seaborn/Matplotlib  
- Structured EDA workflow from raw data to insight  
- Clean, readable code with inline comments  

---

## 💡 Use Cases
- Risk analytics for public safety  
- Data validation for government or civic tech dashboards  
- Preprocessing step for machine learning models in crime prediction
